The env.hcl configuration will look like the following:

locals {
  env = "qa" # this will be prod in the prod folder, and stage in the stage folder.
}
We can then load the env.hcl file in the _env/app.hcl file to load the env string:

locals {
  # Load the relevant env.hcl file based on where terragrunt was invoked. This works because find_in_parent_folders
  # always works at the context of the child configuration.
  env_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  env_name = local.env_vars.locals.env


  --------------
you can use git diff to collect all the files that changed, and for those terragrunt.hcl files that were updated, you can run terragrunt plan or terragrunt apply by passing in the updated file with --terragrunt-config.

  However, for include blocks, you can use the â€“terragrunt-modules-that-include CLI option for the run-all command.
